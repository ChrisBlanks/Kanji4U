# Kanji4U
## Author: ChrisB

Japanese language studying application. Mainly focuses on the memorization of Kanji. This app 
leverages the KANJIDIC Project's dictionary of Kanji characters ([link](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project)) and related information, but it 
can be extended to use other sources/standards as well. 

The Kanji characters are grouped together in typical categories (e.g. JLPT level).
